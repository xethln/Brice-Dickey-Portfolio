# Brice Dickey | Cybersecurity Portfolio

Welcome to my cybersecurity portfolio!  
I’m an **aspiring SOC Analyst** and a **beginner in cybersecurity**, but I bring over 8 years of hands-on experience in technical problem-solving and reverse engineering from my background as an Automotive Security Specialist.  

I’m transitioning into cybersecurity with a focus on **SOC analysis, incident response, and threat detection**. My approach is hands-on: I learn best by doing labs, solving problems, and applying concepts to real-world scenarios.
